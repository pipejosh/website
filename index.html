                <p>Super Boy’s has been operating since 1985. Opened by Angelo Corantzopoulos and his family, Super Boy’s has been making world class food since it opened its doors.
Homemade is the key to everything they serve. From fresh burger patties to their home made fries, to their home-made chili, gravy and all their sauces—everything is made from scratch. And you can taste the difference! <br> Angelo has been joined by his daughter, Georgia Chouzouris, and son-in-law, Dino, in operating Super Boy’s. They maintain the same level of quality and service as they did back in 1985. What makes Super Boy’s a landmark is that it is more of a family restaurant than a burger shop. Mind you, the burgers are what people keep coming for. <br> Be sure to ask for a custom-sized burger. So far the record is a 9-patty Super Boy. Can you do 10?</p>
