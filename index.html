                    Super Boy’s has been operating since 1985. Opened by Angelo Corantzopoulos and his family, Super Boy’s has been making world class food since it opened its doors. <br> <br>
                    Homemade is the key to everything they serve. From fresh burger patties to their home made fries, to their home-made chili, gravy and all their sauces—everything is made from scratch. And you can taste the difference! <br><br> Angelo has been joined by his daughter, Georgia Chouzouris, and son-in-law, Dino, in operating Super Boy’s. They maintain the same level of quality and service as they did back in 1985. What makes Super Boy’s a landmark is that it is more of a family restaurant than a burger shop. Mind you, the burgers are what people keep coming for. <br><br> Be sure to ask for a custom-sized burger. So far the record is a 9-patty Super Boy. Can you do 10?
